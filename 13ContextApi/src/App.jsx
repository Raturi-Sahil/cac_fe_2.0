    ðŸ§  1. What is UserContextProvider?
          Itâ€™s a custom component that provides a shared state (user, setUser) to everything inside it via React Context.

    ðŸ§’ 2. What is children?
          In React, children is a special prop.
          It refers to whatever you wrap inside a component.

    ðŸ“¦ 3. Why we use {children} inside the provider?
          Because we want to wrap some UI (our app) and inject context into it. The {children} allows this component to pass the context to everything it wraps.
